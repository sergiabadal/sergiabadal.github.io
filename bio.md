Sergi Abadal received the PhD in Computer Architecture from the Department of Computer Architecture, Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC), Barcelona, Spain, in July 2016. Previously, he had obtained the M.Sc. in Information and Communication Technologies (MINT) and the B.Sc. in Telecommunication Engineering from the Telecommunication Engineering School (Telecom BCN), UPC, Barcelona, Spain, in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Sergi has held several visiting researcher positions. From September 2009 to May 2010, he was at the Broadband Wireless Networking Lab, Georgia Tech, under the supervision of Prof. Ian F. Akyildiz. For several months in 2015/2017/2019, he has been visiting the i-acoma group, School of Computer Science, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign (USA), led by Prof. Josep Torrellas. In July and August 2018, he visited Dr. Liaskos and Dr. Ioannidis at FORTH, Crete, Greece.

Currently, he works as a distinguished researcher at the Department of Computer Architecture of UPC. He is the recipient of a Starting Grant, called [WINC](https://www.winc-project.eu/), from the European Research Council (ERC) and also the project coordinator of WIPLASH H2020 FET-OPEN project, while in the past he participated in several other national and EU projects. He is the author of 150+ publications in first-tier venues in very diverse fields from nanotechnology to computer architecture. Thanks to his efforts, in 2024, he received the "Agustín de Betancourt" medal awarded by the Real Academia de la Ingeniería annually to the top 10 young researchers in Spain. He also received the ACM NanoCom Outstanding Milestone Award in 2022 and the Young Investigator Award of the Nano Communication Networks Journal in September 2019. Sergi is also very active in terms of service, education, and outreach. He served in over 50 workshops and conferences. He is also active in editorial work with different positions such as Associate Editor-in-Chief of Digital Media of the IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems (since 2024) and Associate Editor of the IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing (since 2023), and others. He has given over 20 invited talks with an accumulated audience of 280.000 people, and supervises or has supervised 62 MSc students and 17 PhD students, including industrial PhDs with Telefónica Research or Qualcomm. 

In 2024, he became the Director of the [Nanonetworking Center in Catalunya (N3Cat)](https://n3cat.upc.edu/), managing a group of 30+ researchers. Through his dedication and distinguished international collaborators, he plans to continue extending his horizons in several areas of research, including but not limited to wireless communications in extreme environments and the application of such commuunications for the creation of networks beyong 6G, novel computing systems in the classical and quantum domains, or groundbreaking systems for the early detection of cancer directy from the bloodstream. Sergi is a Senior Member of the IEEE, and member of the ACM and HiPEAC.
