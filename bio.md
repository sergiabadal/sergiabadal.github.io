### Biography

Sergi Abadal received the PhD in Computer Architecture from the Department of Computer Architecture, Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC), Barcelona, Spain, in July 2016. Previously, he had obtained the M.Sc. in Information and Communication Technologies (MINT) and the B.Sc. in Telecommunication Engineering from the Telecommunication Engineering School (Telecom BCN), UPC, Barcelona, Spain, in 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Sergi has held several visiting researcher positions. From September 2009 to May 2010, he was at the Broadband Wireless Networking Lab, Georgia Tech, under the supervision of Prof. Ian F. Akyildiz. For several months in 2015/2017/2019, he has been visiting the i-acoma group, School of Computer Science, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign (USA), led by Prof. Josep Torrellas. In July and August 2018, he visited Dr. Liaskos and Dr. Ioannidis at FORTH, Crete, Greece.

Currently, he works as a distinguished researcher at the N3Cat group, at the Computer Architecture Department of the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC). He is the recipient of a Starting Grant, called WINC, from the European Research Council (ERC) and also the project coordinator of WIPLASH H2020 FET-OPEN project, while in the past he participated in several other national and EU projects. He is also Area Editor of the Nano Communication Networks (Elsevier) Journal, where he was selected Editor of the Year 2019. From 2020, he acts as one of the ambassadors of the European Innovation Council (EIC) through its program of National Champions. His current research interests are in the areas of chip-scale wireless communications, including channel modeling and protocol design, and the application of these techniques for the creation of novel architectures for next-generation computing systems in the classical and quantum domains. Sergi is member of the IEEE, ACM, and HiPEAC.
