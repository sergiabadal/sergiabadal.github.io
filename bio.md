### Biography

Sergi Abadal received the PhD in Computer Architecture from the Department of Computer Architecture, Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC), Barcelona, Spain, in July 2016. Previously, he had obtained the M.Sc. in Information and Communication Technologies (MINT) and the B.Sc. in Telecommunication Engineering from the Telecommunication Engineering School (Telecom BCN), UPC, Barcelona, Spain, in 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Sergi has held several visiting researcher positions. From September 2009 to May 2010, he was at the Broadband Wireless Networking Lab, Georgia Tech, under the supervision of Prof. Ian F. Akyildiz. For several months in 2015/2017/2019, he has been visiting the i-acoma group, School of Computer Science, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign (USA), led by Prof. Josep Torrellas. In July and August 2018, he visited Dr. Liaskos and Dr. Ioannidis at FORTH, Crete, Greece.

Currently, he works as a PostDoc researcher at the N3Cat group, at the Computer Architecture Department of the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC). He is the project coordinator of WIPLASH FET-OPEN project, and has participated in several national and EU projects. He is also Area Editor of the Nano Communication Networks (Elsevier) Journal, where we has selected Editor of the Year 2019. From 2020, he acts as one of the ambassadors the European Innovation Council (EIC) through its program of National Champions. His current research interests are in the areas of chip-scale wireless communications, including channel modeling and protocol design, the application of these techniques for the creation next-generation wireless networks for on-chip or within metamaterial networks, and their implications at the architecture/system design level. Sergi is member of the IEEE, ACM, and HiPEAC.
